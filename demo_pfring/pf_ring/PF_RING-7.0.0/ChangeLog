* Examples
 - Added ability to replay a packet with pfsend passing hex from stdin
 - Added pfwrite to the package
 - Fix for rate control with huge files in pfsend

---------------------------------------
2013-01-09 PF_RING 5.5.2

* PF_RING library
 - New pfring_open() flag PF_RING_DNA_FIXED_RSS_Q_0 to send all traffic to queue 0.
   Other queues can be selected using hw filters (DNA cards with hw filtering only).
 - Added ability to create a stats file under /proc/net/pf_ring/stats so that
   applications can report stats via the /proc filesystem.
  - pfring_set_application_stats() for reporting stats
  - pfring_get_appl_stats_file_name() for getting the exac filename where the app sets the statistics

* DNA drivers
 - Flow Control disabled by default with the ixgbe-dna driver

* Sample apps
 - New pfdump.c sample app
 - Userspace BPF support with DNA in pfcount.c
 - pfcount.c and pfsend.c update to report stats using pfring_set_application_stats()

* Libzero
 - New experimental pfring_register_zerocopy_tx_ring()
 - New pfdnacluster_mt_rss_frwd sample app (packet forwarding using Libzero
 DNA Cluster for rx/balancing and standard DNA with zero-copy on RSS queues for tx)

* Libpcap
 - pcap_get_pfring_id()
 - pcap_set_master_id()
 - pcap_set_master()
 - pcap_set_application_name()
 - pcap_set_watermark()

* BUG fixes
 - Fix for corrupted VLAN tagged packets
 - Fix for wrong packet len with vlan stripping offload

---------------------------------------
2012-11-24 PF_RING 5.5.1

- updated ixgbe driver to release 3.11.33
- Fixed bug that was causing ixgbe driver not to disable interrupts. This was causing
  a high load on the core handling the interrupts for ixgbe-based card
- libzero: various hugepages improvements and bug fixes
- Added ability to specify PF_RING_RX_PACKET_BOUNCE in pfring_open
- Fixed minor memory leak
- Various improvements to support of hardware timestamp on Silicom Intel-based 10 Gbit adapters
- DNA Bouncer: added direction to pfring_dna_bouncer_decision_func callback (useful in bidirectional mode)
- DNA Cluster: added dna_cluster_set_hugepages_mountpoint() to manually select the hugepages mount point when several are available
- Created architecture specific versions of libzero/DNA for exploiting latest generation of CPUs and thus improve performance
- Update PF_RING-aware igb update (4.0.17)
- Added pf_ring calls to pcap apps

---------------------------------------
2012-11-01 PF_RING 5.5.0
