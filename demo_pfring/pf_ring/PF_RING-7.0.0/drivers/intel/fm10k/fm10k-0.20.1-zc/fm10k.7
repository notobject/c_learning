.SH NAME
fm10k \-This file describes the Intel(R) Ethernet Switch
Host Interface Driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe fm10k [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.32\fR and newer kernels. 
This driver includes support for any 64 bit Linux supported system, 
including Itanium(R)2, x86_64, PPC64,ARM, etc.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is
not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of
the drivers.


For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.SH Jumbo Frames
.LP
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU) to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the
following where <x> is the interface number:

   ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up

.LP
NOTES:
- The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 15342. This value coincides
  with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 15364 bytes.
- This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive
  each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues
  when allocating receive packets.
See the section "Jumbo Frames" in the Readme.
